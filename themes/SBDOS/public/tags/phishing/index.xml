      <description>My modification of GoPhish Status Task Description ☑️ Activity detected statistic Statistic that is detecting if the link was opened in real browser - it could be useful when sandbox arrives. It could be added with the landing page section. ☑️ Displaying proper data in charts So gophish has a system that is showing statistic in wrong way. Now every event is collected and displayed. F.e submitted data does not mean that link was clicked.</description>
